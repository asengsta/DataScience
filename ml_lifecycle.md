# DataScience and Machine Learning Project Lifecycle
This page covers the machine learning and data science lifecycle.  How do you approach a new probem?

### Problem Overview
* What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
* Why do you need to solve it?

### Data
* What data is available?
* What is the format?
* What is the ammount?
* How will you gather more data over time?

### Algorithms | Modeling
* What are traditional approaches to these types of problems?
* What algorithms are used?
* How would you solve to problem?

For each potential solution:
1. Build a quick solution
2. Determine a success metric

Keep the promisiong solutions and discard all others

### Optimize
* Try to improve each candidate solution
* Iterate to make it better, however don't focus on the super optimzed solution, just one that works

### Iterate 
Look back at the above steps

* Does the proposed solution match the problem?
* Is the solution good enough?  How are you grading it?
* Are there limitations / trade offs?  Are they documented?  Are they acceptable?

### Deployment
* How will users interact with the model
* How will you deploy the model to meet this interaction?

### Monitoring
* Now that your model is in production, how will you monitor the predictions?
* How do you capture data?
* What is the metric that causes you to take the model offline / retrain?
