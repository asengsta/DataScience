### What does a machine learning engineer do?
There is a misconception that machine learning engineers just train models.  This is actually a very small fraction of the work.  I believe this misunderstanding comes from many Introductory machine learning courses.  Those courses focus on machine learning algorithms and training.  As such the misconception propagates.

So what does a machine learning engineer do?  At the highest level - the same thing other engineers do:  solve problem and communicate.  

* Research on how to solve problems, how to approach new problems
* Proposals - propose and document a solution to solve a problem, staying within budget and schedule requirements
* Gather requirements on what the problem is to be solved
* Communicate to other engineers, business leads, and stakeholders.  This communication should be constant throughout the project lifecycle
* Clean / Visualize / Mung / feature engineering data.  What if data isn't available?  A good ML engineer should be able to design a data collection / labeling pipeline
* Design ML Models to address the problem requirements
* Move a solution from exploration to production
* Monitor a model in production.  Capture prediction data and improve the model over time via retraining
